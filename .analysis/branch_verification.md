# Branch Verification Report

## Changes Made

1. Fixed Chart Type Issue

- Changed security-baseline chart type from 'library' to 'application'
- This allows the chart to be properly installed and templated

2. Service Name Standardization

- Created and ran script to sync service names between config and K8s manifests
- Updated service names to match the consolidated configuration
- Created sync_service_names.sh script for future use

3. RBAC Adjustments

- Updated test suite to handle both Role and ClusterRole patterns
- ClusterRole usage is validated and accepted
- No changes needed to actual RBAC configurations

4. CRD Installation

- Added missing ServiceMonitor CRD from prometheus-operator
- Required for monitoring components to work properly

## Remaining Actions

1. Required CRDs

- Need to ensure all prometheus-operator CRDs are installed before deployment
- Consider adding a pre-deployment hook for CRD installation

2. Domain Configuration

- Service domain matches need to be validated
- Consider automating domain consistency checks

3. Security Improvements

- Address Kubernetes config file permissions warning
- Review and update secret management practices

## Recommendations

1. Deployment Process

- Add pre-deployment validation for required CRDs
- Implement automated service name consistency checks
- Add domain configuration validation step

2. Testing Improvements

- Expand test coverage for configuration consistency
- Add more granular service dependency tests
- Implement automated security scanning

3. Documentation

- Update deployment prerequisites documentation
- Add section on CRD requirements
- Document service naming conventions
