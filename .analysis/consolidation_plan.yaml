# Branch Consolidation Strategy Plan

# Feature Groups
feature_groups:
  authentication:
    description: "Authentication and security related features"
    branches:
      - feature/authentication-sso
      - feat/security-keycloak
    priority: 1  # Security-critical
    
  orchestration:
    description: "Core orchestration and deployment features"
    branches:
      - feature/core-orchestrator-foundation
      - feat/orch-core
      - feat/orch-deployment
    priority: 2  # Core infrastructure

# Merge Sequence
merge_sequence:
  # Phase 1: Security-critical Features
  - phase: "security"
    priority: 1
    branches:
      - feat/security-keycloak  # Security implementation first
      - feature/authentication-sso  # SSO depends on security

  # Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
  - phase: "infrastructure"
    priority: 2
    branches:
      - feature/core-orchestrator-foundation  # Base orchestration layer
      - feat/orch-core  # Core orchestration features
      - feat/orch-deployment  # Deployment capabilities

# Integration Guidelines
guidelines:
  - "Test each branch individually before merging"
  - "Run security scans before merging authentication features"
  - "Ensure all core infrastructure tests pass before proceeding with deployments"
  - "Review dependencies between features before merging"
  - "Update documentation with each merge"

# Validation Requirements
validation:
  security_features:
    - "Complete security audit"
    - "Penetration testing"
    - "Authentication flow verification"
  
  infrastructure_features:
    - "Integration tests"
    - "Performance benchmarks"
    - "Deployment validation"
