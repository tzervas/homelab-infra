## Outstanding Work & Stashes

### Stashed Changes

- **stash@{0}**: WIP on develop: 439b8c6 "feat: comprehensive script reorganization and refactoring"
  - Contains uncommitted work on the develop branch
  - Needs to be reviewed and either applied or dropped

### Uncommitted Changes

- **Untracked files**: `homelab-infra/` directory
  - Large untracked directory structure present
  - Appears to be a duplicate/nested repository structure
  - Requires investigation for consolidation

## Key Observations

### Strengths

1. **Clear branching strategy**: main → develop → feature branches
2. **Active development**: Recent commits across multiple branches
3. **Good commit practices**: Descriptive commit messages with conventional format
4. **Cleanup efforts**: Active cleanup branches for repository maintenance

### Concerns

1. **Untracked duplication**: Large `homelab-infra/` directory suggests structural issues
2. **Stashed work**: Uncommitted changes on develop branch need attention
3. **Pending merges**: Multiple cleanup branches awaiting integration
4. **Branch divergence**: Feature branch significantly ahead of main

### Branch Complexity Metrics

- **Total branches**: 11 (5 local, 6 remote)
- **Active branches**: 3 (develop, feature/homelab-portal-security-dashboard, main)
- **Cleanup branches**: 2 (both cleanup/* branches)
- **Merge candidates**: 4 branches not merged to main
- **Commits ahead of main**:
  - develop: ~4 commits
  - feature/homelab-portal-security-dashboard: ~5 commits

## Repository Structure Issues

### Duplicate Directory Structure

The presence of `homelab-infra/` as an untracked directory containing a near-complete copy of the repository structure suggests:

- Possible nested git repository
- Backup or migration artifact
- Potential cause of confusion and conflicts

### File System Analysis

- **Root level files**: 50+ files including configs, scripts, documentation
- **Major directories**: ansible/, helm/, kubernetes/, scripts/, terraform/
- **Duplicate structure**: homelab-infra/ contains similar structure
- **Test artifacts**: Multiple test result files and logs

## Recommendations for Consolidation

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Investigate duplicate structure**: Determine origin and purpose of homelab-infra/ directory
2. **Resolve stashed changes**: Review and integrate or discard stash@{0}
3. **Clean untracked files**: Address the untracked homelab-infra/ directory
4. **Merge cleanup branches**: Complete pending cleanup branch merges

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Branch lifecycle**: Establish clear criteria for branch retirement
2. **Integration testing**: Ensure feature branches are properly tested before merge
3. **Documentation**: Update branching strategy documentation
4. **Backup strategy**: Implement proper backup before major restructuring

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive backup (Step 2)
2. Analyze branch differences in detail (Step 3)  
3. Design unified branch structure (Step 4)
4. Implement incremental merge strategy (Step 5)
