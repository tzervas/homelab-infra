   - Unified CLI interface with Rich UI
   - Async deployment management
   - Health monitoring and validation
   - Webhook server for integrations
   - Portal management system

2. **Security Framework**
   - Environment-based secret management
   - Secure OAuth2 configuration
   - TLS/SSL validation
   - Security scanning integration

3. **Configuration System**
   - YAML-based configuration with validation
   - Environment-specific overrides
   - Template processing with variable substitution
   - Comprehensive schema validation

4. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD integration
   - Multi-environment support
   - Dry-run capabilities
   - Health check validation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Generate Secure Secrets
```bash
./scripts/security/generate-secrets.sh
```

### 2. Validate Configuration
```bash
python -m homelab_orchestrator config validate
```

### 3. Deploy Certificate Management
```bash
python -m homelab_orchestrator certificates deploy
```

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure (Dry-run)
```bash
python -m homelab_orchestrator deploy infrastructure --components metallb cert_manager --dry-run
```

### 5. Deploy to Environment
```bash
# Development (uses Let's Encrypt staging)
python -m homelab_orchestrator --environment development deploy infrastructure

# Production (uses Let's Encrypt production)
python -m homelab_orchestrator --environment production deploy infrastructure
```

### 6. Validate Certificates and System
```bash
python -m homelab_orchestrator certificates validate
python -m homelab_orchestrator certificates check-expiry
python -m homelab_orchestrator status
python -m homelab_orchestrator health check --comprehensive
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Implemented Security Measures
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in version control
- ✅ Environment variable-based configuration
- ✅ Secure secret generation with OpenSSL
- ✅ File permissions (600) for sensitive files
- ✅ Comprehensive security scanning in CI/CD
- ✅ TLS/SSL validation in orchestrator
- ✅ OAuth2 proxy with environment-based secrets

### Security Best Practices
- Secrets are generated with cryptographically secure random values
- Base64 encoding for Kubernetes secrets
- Regular security scanning with multiple tools
- Principle of least privilege in configurations
- Secure defaults throughout the system

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Before (Multiple Scripts)
- Scattered bash deployment scripts
- Hardcoded secrets in YAML files
- Manual configuration management
- Inconsistent error handling
- No unified interface

### After (Unified Orchestrator)
- Single Python-based orchestrator
- Environment-driven secret management
- Centralized configuration system
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Rich CLI interface with progress indicators

## 🔄 Clean Architecture

### Eliminated Duplicate Scripts
The MVP consolidation removed redundant deployment scripts while preserving the comprehensive K3s testing framework at `testing/k3s-validation/` (755+ lines of sophisticated testing modules).

### Resolved Configuration Conflicts
- Fixed schema validation errors (7 invalid files → 0 invalid files)
- Standardized environment variable usage
- Centralized service configuration
- Unified resource management
