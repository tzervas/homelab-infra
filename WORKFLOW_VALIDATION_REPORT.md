## Workflow Usage Guide

### Using the Python Orchestrator (Recommended)

The centralized Python orchestrator now manages all workflows:

```bash
# Complete infrastructure deployment
python -m homelab_orchestrator deploy infrastructure

# Comprehensive teardown
python -m homelab_orchestrator manage teardown --force

# System health validation
python -m homelab_orchestrator health check --comprehensive

# System status
python -m homelab_orchestrator status
```

### Using Individual Scripts

```bash
# Teardown workflow
./teardown-homelab-complete.sh

# Deployment workflow  
./deploy-homelab-with-sso.sh

# Validation workflow
./validate-deployment-complete.sh

# Health monitoring
./scripts/health-monitor.sh
```
