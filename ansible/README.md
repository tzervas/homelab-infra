# Ansible Directory

This directory contains Ansible configurations and playbooks for the homelab infrastructure project.

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project maintains Ansible playbooks for system-level configuration and provisioning tasks only. All application deployments have transitioned to Helm-based management. The Ansible directory is now focused on:
- Initial server provisioning playbooks
- System-level configuration (network, storage, kernel parameters)
- Bootstrap tasks for Terraform/Helm prerequisites
- Infrastructure validation and health checks

## Migration Status

### ‚úÖ Migrated to Helm/Helmfile
The following functionality has been successfully migrated to Helm-based deployment:

- **Service Deployments**: GitLab, Keycloak, monitoring stack
- **Infrastructure Components**: MetalLB, cert-manager, ingress controllers
- **Storage Solutions**: Longhorn distributed storage
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, alerting

### üîÑ Current Ansible Usage
Ansible is now used for:

- **System Bootstrapping**: Initial server setup and system package installation
- **System Configuration**: Network, storage, and kernel parameter configuration
- **K3s Installation**: Kubernetes cluster bootstrap (system-level only)
- **User Management**: SSH key distribution and deployment user setup
- **Infrastructure Validation**: System readiness and health checks
- **Bootstrap Prerequisites**: Terraform and Helm tooling installation

## Integration with New Structure

### Configuration Integration
- Uses configuration from `../config/environments/` for environment-specific settings
- Integrates with `.env` and `.env.private.local` for host definitions
- Complements rather than conflicts with Helm deployments

### Script Integration
- Called by setup scripts in `../scripts/setup/`
- Used for initial system preparation before K3s deployment
- Supports the overall deployment workflow

## Usage

### Complete System Provisioning
```bash
# Run complete system provisioning (recommended)
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml site.yml

# Run with specific system components
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml site.yml -e "system_components=['bootstrap','k3s']"
```

### Individual System Tasks
```bash
# Bootstrap system prerequisites
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/bootstrap-system.yml

# Deploy K3s cluster
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/deploy-k3s-fixed.yml

# Configure system networking
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/configure-networking.yml

# Set up deployment user
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/setup-deployment-user.yml
```

### System Validation
```bash
# Validate complete deployment setup
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/validate-deployment-setup.yml

# Test authentication
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/test-authentication.yml

# Check connectivity
ansible all -i inventory/hosts.yml -m ping
```

### System Cleanup
```bash
# Clean system for fresh deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml site.yml -e "phase=cleanup-bare-metal"
```

## Future Direction

### Planned Evolution
- **Reduce Scope**: Focus on system-level tasks only
- **Complement Helm**: Work alongside, not replace, Helm deployments
- **Bootstrap Focus**: Primarily for initial system preparation
- **Validation Role**: System health and readiness checks

### Migration Benefits
The migration to Helm provides:
- **Declarative Management**: Better state management for applications
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Easy rollback and update procedures
- **Kubernetes Native**: Better integration with K3s cluster
- **Simplified Operations**: Reduced complexity in deployment management

## Legacy Playbooks

The following playbooks were part of the previous deployment approach and have been superseded:

- `deploy-gitlab.yml` ‚Üí GitLab Helm chart
- `deploy-keycloak.yml` ‚Üí Keycloak Helm chart  
- `deploy-cert-manager.yml` ‚Üí cert-manager Helm chart
- `deploy-metallb.yml` ‚Üí MetalLB Helm chart
- `deploy-monitoring.yml` ‚Üí Prometheus/Grafana Helm charts
- `deploy-nginx-ingress.yml` ‚Üí nginx-ingress Helm chart

These are maintained for reference but are no longer actively used in the deployment process.

## Contributing

When working with Ansible components:

1. **Focus on System Tasks**: Use Ansible for OS-level configuration only
2. **Avoid Application Deployment**: Use Helm for application deployments
3. **Complement Helm**: Ensure Ansible tasks support rather than conflict with Helm
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep this README updated with any changes
