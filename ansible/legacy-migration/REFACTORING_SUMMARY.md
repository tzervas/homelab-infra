# Ansible Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to minimize Ansible to system-level tasks only, migrating all application deployments to Helm-based management.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Legacy Migration Directory
- **Location**: `ansible/legacy-migration/`
- **Purpose**: Archive application deployment references and provide migration context
- **Contents**:
  - `README.md` - Detailed migration explanation
  - `site.yml.archived` - Original site.yml with application deployment references
  - `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### 2. Refactored Main Site Playbook
- **File**: `ansible/site.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed all application deployment include_tasks
  - Focused on system-level provisioning and configuration
  - Added clear documentation about Helm-based application management
  - Introduced `system_components` variable for modular system configuration
  - Added system status tracking and logging

### 3. Updated Existing Playbooks for Idempotency
- **Modified Files**:
  - `playbooks/deploy-k3s-fixed.yml` - Enhanced for system-level focus
  - `playbooks/install-tools.yml` - Improved idempotency
- **Improvements**:
  - Added better task descriptions and documentation
  - Ensured all tasks are idempotent
  - Enhanced error handling and status reporting

### 4. Created New System-Level Playbooks
- **`playbooks/bootstrap-system.yml`**:
  - System package installation and updates
  - Hostname and timezone configuration
  - Security hardening (SSH, firewall basics)
  - Performance tuning (kernel parameters)
  - System directory structure creation

- **`playbooks/configure-networking.yml`**:
  - System-level firewall configuration
  - Network interface management
  - K3s networking prerequisites

- **`playbooks/configure-storage.yml`**:
  - System storage directory creation
  - Disk usage monitoring
  - Log rotation configuration

- **`playbooks/configure-users.yml`**:
  - SSH key distribution
  - User privilege configuration
  - Deployment user role integration

- **`playbooks/cleanup-system.yml`**:
  - System resource cleanup
  - Temporary file removal
  - Status file reset for fresh deployments

### 5. Updated Inventory Configuration
- **File**: `ansible/inventory/hosts.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `deploy_components` with `system_components`
  - Focused on system configuration components only
  - Maintained network configuration for reference

### 6. Comprehensive README Update
- **File**: `ansible/README.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated current status to reflect minimal scope
  - Revised directory structure documentation
  - Enhanced usage examples for system-focused tasks
  - Added comprehensive command examples
  - Clarified the relationship with Helm deployments

## Scope Definition

### What Ansible Now Handles
âœ… **System-Level Tasks**:
- Initial server provisioning and bootstrapping
- OS package installation and updates
- System configuration (network, storage, kernel)
- K3s cluster installation and setup
- User and SSH key management
- System validation and health checks
- Bootstrap prerequisites for Terraform/Helm

### What Has Been Migrated to Helm
ðŸ”„ **Application Deployments**:
- GitLab â†’ Helm chart in `helm/charts/gitlab/`
- Keycloak â†’ Helm chart in `helm/charts/keycloak/`
- cert-manager â†’ Helm chart in `helm/charts/cert-manager/`
- MetalLB â†’ Helm chart in `helm/charts/metallb/`
- nginx-ingress â†’ Helm chart in `helm/charts/nginx-ingress/`
- Monitoring stack â†’ Helm charts in `helm/charts/monitoring/`

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Ansible**: System and infrastructure provisioning
- **Helm**: Kubernetes application management
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code

### 2. Improved Maintainability
- All Ansible tasks are now idempotent
- Better documentation and error handling
- Modular system component structure
- Comprehensive status tracking

### 3. Enhanced Reliability
- System-level tasks are more stable
- Application deployments use Kubernetes-native tooling
- Better rollback and upgrade capabilities for applications
- Reduced complexity in deployment management

### 4. Better Developer Experience
- Clear usage examples and documentation
- Modular execution of system components
- Comprehensive validation and testing playbooks
- Status tracking and logging throughout

## Usage Examples

### Complete System Setup
```bash
# Full system provisioning
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml site.yml

# Bootstrap only
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml site.yml -e "system_components=['bootstrap']"

# Bootstrap and K3s
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml site.yml -e "system_components=['bootstrap','k3s']"
```

### Individual Tasks
```bash
# System bootstrap
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/bootstrap-system.yml

# K3s deployment
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/deploy-k3s-fixed.yml

# System validation
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.yml playbooks/validate-deployment-setup.yml
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the refactored playbooks** in the development environment
2. **Validate system provisioning** works correctly with new structure
3. **Ensure Helm integration** works seamlessly after system setup
4. **Update related documentation** in other parts of the project
5. **Consider automation scripts** that tie Ansible system setup with Helm deployments

This refactoring establishes a clean separation between system provisioning (Ansible) and application deployment (Helm), providing a more maintainable and scalable infrastructure management approach.
