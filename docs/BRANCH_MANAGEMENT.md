# Branch Management Guide

## Overview

This document details the branch management strategy and current branch organization for the Homelab Infrastructure project.

## Branch Organization

### Feature Branches (`feat/*`)

#### Configuration System

These branches handle different aspects of the configuration management system:

- `feat/config-base`: Base configuration structure
- `feat/config-core-loading`: Core configuration loading mechanisms
- `feat/config-domains-env`: Domain and environment configuration
- `feat/config-env-handling`: Environment variable handling
- `feat/config-environments`: Environment-specific configurations
- `feat/config-network`: Network configuration management
- `feat/config-resources`: Resource allocation and management
- `feat/config-service-specific`: Service-specific configurations
- `feat/config-services`: Service management and configuration

#### Orchestration System

Branches related to the orchestration system components:

- `feat/orch-core` and related branches: Core orchestration functionality
- `feat/orch-deployment` and related branches: Deployment management
- `feat/orch-portal`: Web interface and management portal
- `feat/orch-security`: Security implementation
- `feat/orch-validation`: System validation and testing

#### Infrastructure

Core infrastructure components:

- `feat/infra-apps`: Application infrastructure
- `feat/infra-base`: Base infrastructure setup
- `feat/infra-security`: Security infrastructure
- `feat/kubernetes-base`: Base Kubernetes configuration
- `feat/monitoring-base`: Monitoring infrastructure

### Major Feature Branches (`feature/*`)

These branches represent larger, more comprehensive features:

- `feature/ai-ml-gpu-infrastructure`: GPU infrastructure for AI/ML
- `feature/authentication-sso`: SSO authentication system
- `feature/configuration-management`: Configuration system
- `feature/core-orchestrator-foundation`: Core orchestrator
- `feature/monitoring-dashboards`: Monitoring system
- `feature/security-cicd-infrastructure`: CI/CD security

### Fix Branches (`fix/*`)

- `fix/docs-markdown-standards`: Documentation standardization
- `fix/improve-type-checking`: Enhanced type checking

## Branch Management Procedures

1. Branch Creation
   - Create feature branches from `main`
   - Use appropriate prefix (`feat/`, `feature/`, `fix/`)
   - Keep branch names descriptive and focused

2. Branch Maintenance
   - Regularly sync with `main`
   - Resolve conflicts promptly
   - Keep branches focused and small

3. Merge Procedures
   - Create pull request for review
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation
   - Squash commits if necessary

4. Documentation
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add branch-specific documentation
   - Maintain merge resolution notes

## Branch Lifecycle

1. Creation
   - Branch from main
   - Set up initial documentation

2. Development
   - Regular commits
   - Documentation updates
   - Test implementation

3. Review
   - Code review
   - Documentation review
   - Test verification

4. Merge
   - Final testing
   - Documentation update
   - Clean merge to main

5. Cleanup
   - Archive or delete branch
   - Update status documentation
