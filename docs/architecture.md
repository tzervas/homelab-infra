# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

Agent Mode is designed as a terminal-based AI assistant that integrates with development workflows. The system is built with modularity and extensibility in mind.

## Component Relationships

### Core Components

1. **Terminal Interface**
   - Handles user input/output
   - Manages terminal state
   - Processes commands

2. **AI Engine**
   - Processes natural language queries
   - Generates contextual responses
   - Maintains conversation state

3. **Tool Integration**
   - File operations
   - Git operations
   - Project management
   - Code analysis

### Data Flow

```
User Input -> Terminal Interface -> AI Engine -> Tool Integration -> System Action
     ^                                                                    |
     |                                                                    v
User Output <- Terminal Interface <- AI Engine <- Tool Integration <- Action Result
```

## Security Considerations

- GPG signing for all commits
- Secure credential management
- No sensitive data in version control
- Least privilege principle for operations

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extended through:
1. Additional tool integrations
2. Custom command handlers
3. New AI capabilities
4. Additional security measures
