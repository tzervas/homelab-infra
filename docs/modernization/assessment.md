# Infrastructure Modernization Assessment

**Assessment Date:** December 2024  
**Project:** Homelab Infrastructure  
**Assessment Scope:** Ansible ‚Üí Helm + potential Terraform migration  

## Executive Summary

This assessment analyzes the current homelab infrastructure to identify components for modernization and migration.

## Implementation Strategy

### Current State Preservation

- **Keep Ansible for:** System bootstrapping, user management, tool installation
- **Keep Helm for:** Application deployments, Kubernetes resources
- **Add Terraform for:** Infrastructure provisioning, network management, external integrations

### Migration Approach

1. **Parallel Implementation:** Build Terraform infrastructure alongside existing Ansible
2. **Gradual Migration:** Move components one at a time to minimize disruption
3. **Validation at Each Step:** Ensure functionality before deprecating old methods
4. **Rollback Capability:** Maintain ability to return to previous state

### Risk Mitigation

- **Backup Strategy:** Full system backup before each migration phase
- **Testing Environment:** Validate all changes in isolated environment first
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of new workflows
- **Training:** Team familiarity with new tools and processes

## Conclusion

The homelab infrastructure is well-positioned for modernization with a strong foundation already in place through the Ansible-to-Helm migration. The primary opportunities for improvement lie in:

1. **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform for VM and network management
2. **Enhanced Security:** Comprehensive TLS/mTLS and certificate lifecycle management
3. **Operational Efficiency:** Automated provisioning and configuration management
4. **Scalability:** Foundation for future growth and multi-environment support

The proposed phased approach minimizes risk while maximizing the benefits of modern infrastructure management practices. The current Helm-based application deployment strategy should be maintained as it provides excellent declarative management for Kubernetes workloads.

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve Assessment** - Stakeholder review of findings and recommendations
2. **Resource Planning** - Allocate time and resources for migration phases
3. **Environment Setup** - Prepare Terraform workspace and testing environment
4. **Phase 1 Implementation** - Begin with VM infrastructure management migration
5. **Iterative Improvement** - Continuous improvement based on lessons learned
