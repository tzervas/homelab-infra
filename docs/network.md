# Network Configuration

## Overview

Agent Mode operates primarily as a local application with minimal network requirements. This document outlines the network configuration and security considerations.

## Network Requirements

### Local Operations
- Terminal interface runs locally
- File operations are performed locally
- Git operations require network access for remote operations

### External Services
- AI model access (if using remote models)
- Git repository access
- Package management (pip/uv)

## Security Measures

### Authentication
- SSH for Git operations
- GPG for commit signing
- API keys for external services (stored securely)

### Data Privacy
- No sensitive data transmission
- Local processing where possible
- Encrypted communication channels

## Firewall Configuration

### Inbound Rules
- No inbound connections required

### Outbound Rules
- HTTPS (443) for Git operations
- HTTPS (443) for package management
- HTTPS (443) for AI model access (if using remote models)

## Monitoring

- Network usage monitoring
- Connection logging
- Security event tracking
