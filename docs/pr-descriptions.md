# Pull Request Descriptions

## 1. Core Configuration Loading (feat/config-core-loading)

### Title

feat(core): Add core configuration loading functionality

### Description

This PR implements the foundational configuration loading layer for the homelab orchestrator.

#### Key Features

- Basic YAML file loading and caching mechanism
- Generic configuration retrieval with dot-notation support
- Simple reload and export functionality

#### Implementation Details

- Introduces `ConfigContext` dataclass for environment settings
- Implements caching layer for YAML configuration files
- Provides generic dot-notation path-based configuration access
- Includes basic reload and export utilities for debugging

#### Testing

- Verify configuration loading from consolidated directory
- Test dot-notation path access with various scenarios
- Validate caching behavior and reloading

## 2. Environment Configuration (feat/config-env-handling)

### Title

feat(config): Add environment-specific configuration handling

### Description

- Dynamic environment configuration validation

#### Implementation Details

- Adds environment configuration directory handling
- Implements environment-specific override mechanisms
- Provides environment context switching capability
- Includes environment validation logic

#### Testing

- Verify environment-specific overrides work correctly
- Test environment switching functionality
- Validate environment-specific settings

## 3. Service Configuration (feat/config-service-specific)

### Title

feat(config): Add service-specific configuration handling

### Description

This PR implements service-specific configuration management including domain, networking, and security configurations.

#### Key Features

- Domain configuration with environment overrides
- Network configuration with MetalLB pool handling
- Security configuration with context-aware overrides
- Resource and GPU configuration management

#### Implementation Details

- Adds domain configuration with environment suffix handling
- Implements network configuration with MetalLB pool management
- Provides comprehensive security configuration with contextual overrides
- Includes resource scaling and GPU configuration handling

#### Testing

- Verify domain configuration with environment overrides
- Test MetalLB pool configuration handling
- Validate security configuration overrides
- Confirm resource scaling functionality

#### Impact

These changes provide a solid foundation for handling service-specific configurations throughout the homelab infrastructure, ensuring proper environment isolation and security configuration.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Core Configuration Loading
   - Review and merge first as base functionality
   - Provides foundation for other configuration aspects

2. Environment Configuration
   - Review and merge after core functionality
   - Builds on core loading with environment handling

3. Service Configuration
   - Review and merge last
   - Depends on both core and environment functionality

The PRs should be reviewed and merged in this order to maintain a clean dependency chain.
