# Rootless Deployment Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a rootless deployment strategy for the homelab infrastructure, with careful privilege management where elevated permissions are required.

## Goals

1. Run deployment and tests with non-root user by default
2. Configure passwordless sudo for specific commands only where necessary
3. Minimize privilege escalation surface area
4. Maintain security while ensuring functionality
5. Use Ansible to configure the environment properly

## Implementation Steps

### 1. User Configuration

- Create a dedicated deployment user (e.g., `homelab-deploy`)
- Configure specific sudo permissions via sudoers.d
- Set up SSH keys for passwordless authentication

### 2. Ansible Configuration

- Update ansible.cfg for conditional privilege escalation
- Create role for user and permission setup
- Implement task-level privilege control

### 3. Container and Kubernetes Adjustments

- Configure containers for rootless operation
- Update security contexts in Helm charts
- Modify volume permissions as needed

### 4. Testing Framework Updates

- Ensure tests run with appropriate permissions
- Add permission checks before operations
- Handle privilege escalation failures gracefully

### 5. Documentation

- Document required permissions for each component
- Create troubleshooting guide for permission issues
- Maintain security best practices guide
