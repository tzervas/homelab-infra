# Homelab Cluster Validation and Testing Plan

## Overview

Comprehensive plan for debugging, validating, and testing the homelab cluster deployment with all integrated services.

## Key Requirements

### 1. SSO Authentication

- [ ] Validate SSO redirect on landing page access
- [ ] Ensure no unauthenticated access to landing page
- [ ] Test authentication flow with Authentik
- [ ] Verify redirect behavior for authenticated users

### 2. Landing Page Integration

- [ ] Verify all service links are functional
- [ ] Test navigation to each integrated service
- [ ] Validate service availability checks
- [ ] Ensure consistent UI/UX across services

### 3. Grafana Dashboards

- [ ] Create comprehensive cluster overview dashboard
- [ ] Develop compute resources dashboard
- [ ] Build storage metrics dashboard
- [ ] Design security monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create individual service dashboards for:
  - Authentik
  - GitLab
  - ArgoCD
  - Longhorn
  - Vault
  - Prometheus
  - Each deployed application

### 4. Monitoring Features

- [ ] Implement automatic namespace tagging
- [ ] Configure metric labeling standards
- [ ] Set up service discovery
- [ ] Validate alerting rules
- [ ] Test notification channels

### 5. Configuration Management

- [ ] All customization via top-level override files
- [ ] Environment variables from .env
- [ ] No hardcoded values in base configs
- [ ] Proper secret management

### 6. Testing Tasks

- [ ] Service connectivity tests
- [ ] Authentication flow validation
- [ ] Dashboard data source verification
- [ ] Alert rule testing
- [ ] Backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Certificate validation
- [ ] Network policy enforcement

## Technical Implementation

### Python Testing Framework

- Use existing orchestration/monitoring suite
- Leverage UV for package management
- Implement comprehensive test cases
- Generate validation reports

### Pre-commit Checks

- Code quality standards
- Type checking with mypy
- Linting with ruff
- Security scanning with gitleaks
- YAML validation
- Terraform formatting

### Documentation Updates

- Update requirements.md with new services
- Revise architecture diagrams
- Document configuration changes
- Create troubleshooting guides

## Execution Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Initialize UV environment with managed Python
   - Install testing dependencies
   - Configure pre-commit hooks

2. **Validation Suite Development**
   - Extend existing Python monitoring tools
   - Create comprehensive test cases
   - Implement dashboard validation

3. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Design and implement all Grafana dashboards
   - Configure data sources
   - Set up automatic tagging

4. **Testing Execution**
   - Run full validation suite
   - Document results
   - Fix identified issues

5. **Documentation**
   - Update all project documentation
   - Create deployment guide
   - Document configuration options

## Success Criteria

- All services accessible via SSO
- No unauthenticated access possible
- All dashboards displaying correct metrics
- Automated tests passing
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Code quality checks passing
